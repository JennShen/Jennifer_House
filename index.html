      <h3>Welcome Home</h3>
        <h4>Living Room</h4>
        <p> This Virtual Reality home is my vision of the contemporary home in the future. This is a modern and spacious room for everyone, including family, friends, and guests. The comfortable leather sofas invite everyone to relax, chat, and watch movies or TV. The painting and carpet tie together the space. The grand piano is one of my favorite components of the room, as music reverberates throughout the home.</p>

        <h4>Kitchen and Dining Room</h4>

The dining area features the beautiful view of the outside scenery, perfecting the uplifting ambience of the home.
