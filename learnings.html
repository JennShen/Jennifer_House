        <p> This project was both rewarding and fun as I was able to design and create my home of the future. One integral area that I continued to learn about was how to think and design in 3D space. This is crucial to navigation in VR, and I also had to keep in mind the proportions of every object. I was enthralled by designing and creating this home, including the relationships and themes among all the different spaces and models. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Throughout my work on this project, I explored an array of crucial features in building scenes for VR. This includes lighting, colliders, textures, colors, scale, and composition. I aimed to build a home with a contemporary, comfortable ambience and all the amenities that I enjoy. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Paintings, wall decor, and carpets all help tie different objects in a space together. I looked for many possible contenders for textures before winnowing down to the ones that I believe best enhance the spaces. I even added paintings with textures that I made.
